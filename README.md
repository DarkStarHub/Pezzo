# How I workd on this project
I wanted to create a fun landing page for a pizza site. The custom carousel was the feature I enjoyed implenting the most. All of the logic was handled by my Javascript code.
If I were to flesh out an entire working site from this page, I would definitely migrate everything into a REACT environment to take advantage of REACT ROUTER and the performant
nature of REACT SPAs.
